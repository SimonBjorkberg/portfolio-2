It took a few attempts to understand how interfaces worked & how to satisfy useStates to make sure that the types were right across the board but I'm very thankful to myself for learning TypeScript because I know that I save a lot of time by using it.",

I had no real goal in mind for this project other than having a good time while trying to learn how to use TailwindCSS efficiently, and what better way than to improve my climbing gym's website. I got introduced to some CSS libraries and some new concepts and while I copy pasted some of the modals/accordions at the time I can now look back and realise that I can do better custom ones myself in no time at all.",

Me and 2 other classmates were put into a group with the end goal of creating a fullstack React web application & after many hours of discussions we ended up deciding to create an E-commerce website. The biggest challenge that we encountered during this project was the ambition of the project itself combined with a lack of communication & leadership. It made me realise how important a good leader is and what a difference it can make when working on larger projects where you need to divide the work. I was however very glad that the ability to code was at this point the least of my worries.",

It was however an excellent way to learn how to build our own API, define models for our Mongo database & create routes for our own server. This was built by Achref and I, although it wasn't perfect we managed to cover our main goal and some more which was to create a fully functioning CRUD forum application.",
