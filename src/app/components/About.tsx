                        My interest for coding started during my early youth & part of the fascination came from my slight addiction to gaming at the time, I quickly wanted to understand how it all worked under the hood.

                        Late 2022 I started to explore development as a permanent career path as this had been my plan since 2018, I felt that I had to reinforce my knowledge on core concepts in addition to getting a certificate/degree that could solidify what I knew. I got
